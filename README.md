## Contributing

We use [rye](https://rye-up.com/) to manage this project's dependencies. This will handle every aspect from grabbing the correct python, downloading dependencies, and managing a virtual environment.

To get started, install rye:

```bash
curl -sSf https://rye-up.com/get | bash
```

Once installed, you can sync the project to generate a virtual environment and you'll be set!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Smithed-MC/smithed-python
cd smithed-python
rye sync
```
